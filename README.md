# flowfield

dodge and shoot the balls on the screen—but everything follows the flow of the vector field. either work with the flow or fight against it to achieve a high score

[downloading the macos build](https://alixii.itch.io/flowfield) is recommended so that you can submit scores to the online leaderboard! there is also a WASM build available at [itch.io](https://alixii.itch.io/flowfield).

game built with Rust and [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/). online scoreboard built using [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/). all sound effects made by me using Vital (https://vital.audio/) and Ableton Live.
